Hopefully I'll clear things up for people new to modding. It'll be fairly similar to the explanations on GitHub, though I'll add a few more details to clear confusion.

My girlfriend doesn’t play video games a lot, but LocoRoco is one of her few favourite games for its sheer cuteness, simplicity, and calm. Now, I know it’s a Sony exclusive, so I was just wondering if there are any games like it on the Nintendo Switch? (Before anyone mentions Snipperclips, I’m not sure that really has an optimised single-player experience?). I see a lot of articles writing about the failure of Home, but when looking at user based reviews and videos, there’s a majority of people who simply look back in nostalgia and love for the game. There’s not a SINGLE day where I don’t remember one of the areas from the game, and look back in awe and happiness. The tropical island that had a marriage system, the flooded city, the newer science lab thing with the anime girls(?) with the tubes and the puzzles that told you not to be a stranger.

https://youtu.be/lJZWKBDXXFY?t=6035 At 1:40:35 the PS4 dashboard shows some interesting stuff. First off, the Patapon 2 icon. The HD remaster that was announced in 2017. And since then we've not heard about it. What's that to the right? A MediEvil Resurrection icon. So, it seems like the original plan was to just do an HD remaster of Resurrection - the same way HD remasters of other PSP games like LocoRoco, Patapon and Parappa were done via injected HD textures - but then it got changed.

I will be uploading it every other day. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstHUUGDfi4 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AstHUUGDfi4). 
I played this game at around 2005-2014 my memory was blurry back then and I can't remember the details. In the game I think it was about like just going through the obstacles in 2D and you we're some sort of goo and one of the levels that I remembered was you would go through a dead penguin. that's basically it, I don't remember further details as this was one of the games I remember from those early days. Edit: fucking hell, man. I just found it. Edit 2: It was LocoRoco. Hey guys, I’ve had issues with using QCMA back up the demo for the upcoming Vita 3.69/3.70 hack by theflow0. I was able to back up the LocoRoco Midnight Carnival demo on my PS3, after trying all PC ways USB and wifi. Is backing it up on my PS3 enough for me to be able to hack it when the exploit comes. Hey y’all, I’m having issues with my Vita not wanting to connect to the pc via USB or Wifi to back-up a game via qcma. I tried installing different USB drivers as per some guides suggestion this, but no luck. I plan on Jailbreaking my Vita to 3.70 when theflow0 releases the exploit. Do I HAVE to back-up the game(LocoRoco Midnight Carnival demo) or is this a pre-caution theflow0 makes us do? Someone please help. Edit: Also, how come we can’t back-up the game via the content manager.

In it, you guide colored fruit creatures that are pretty much at the bottom of the food chain. I don't know why, but I get serious Pikmin vibes from the game, despite being a completely different game. I get the same feeling of fear/frustration I get whenever one of the fruit monsters die that I get when I lose a Pikmin. It's not an alternintive by a long shot, but I think it's worth trying as a Pikmin.
